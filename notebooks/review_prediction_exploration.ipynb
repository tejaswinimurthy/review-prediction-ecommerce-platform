# Review Prediction for Targeted Customer Incentives

## 1. Business Context
Positive customer reviews play a critical role in online retail, influencing customer trust, product visibility, and conversion rates. However, incentivising every customer to leave a review is costly and inefficient. The business challenge is therefore to identify customers who are most likely to leave a positive (5-star) review so that incentives can be targeted effectively.

This project frames the problem as a decision-support task: using historical order, delivery, and customer data to support more efficient marketing and incentive strategies.


## 2. Data Overview
The analysis is based on a relational eCommerce dataset consisting of multiple tables capturing different aspects of the customer journey.

For this project, the following tables were used:
- Orders
- Order items
- Customers
- Reviews
- Products
- Sellers

The unit of analysis was defined at the **order level**, as reviews are associated with individual orders rather than directly with customers. The orders table was used as the core table, with additional information joined to enrich each order with customer attributes, product characteristics, seller information, and review outcomes.

## 3. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
The raw transactional data was transformed into order-level features designed to capture customer experience, perceived value, and service quality.
Feature engineering focused on variables that are both predictive and interpretable from a business perspective. Below are three representative features used in the modelling stage.

### Feature 1: Delivery Time
- Delivery time measures the number of days between order purchase and customer delivery.
- This feature captures service efficiency and reliability. 
- Longer delivery times are hypothesised to reduce customer satisfaction, while faster deliveries are more likely to result in positive reviews.

### Feature 2: Time Gain
- Time gain measures the difference between the estimated delivery date and the actual delivery date.
- A positive time gain indicates that an order was delivered earlier than expected.
- This feature captures whether the platform exceeded customer expectations, which is strongly linked to higher review scores.

### Feature 3: Total Order Value
- Total order value is calculated as the sum of item prices and delivery fees for each order.
- This feature reflects the overall economic value of the transaction. Higher-value orders may lead to different customer expectations and satisfaction dynamics
compared to low-value purchases.

## 4. Modelling Approach
The prediction task was framed as a **binary classification problem**, where the objective was to identify whether an order would result in a 5-star review or not. This framing aligns with the business goal of targeting incentives only toward customers most likely to leave highly positive reviews, rather than predicting exact rating values.
Several tree-based ensemble models were explored, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models were selected due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships and complex interactions between delivery performance, order characteristics, and customer location.
Among the evaluated models, **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)** provided the most appropriate balance between predictive performance and business interpretability, making it the preferred choice for this use case.


## 5. Evaluation Strategy
Discussion of evaluation metrics (e.g. precision, recall) and how they relate to efficient incentive targeting rather than raw predictive accuracy.

## 6. Business Insights & Recommendations
Interpretation of results and recommendations on whether and how such a model should be deployed in practice.

# Review Prediction for Targeted Customer Incentives

## 1. Business Context
Positive customer reviews play a critical role in online retail, influencing customer trust, product visibility, and conversion rates. However, incentivising every customer to leave a review is costly and inefficient. The business challenge is therefore to identify customers who are most likely to leave a positive (5-star) review so that incentives can be targeted effectively.

This project frames the problem as a decision-support task: using historical order,
delivery, and customer data to support more efficient marketing and incentive
strategies.


## 2. Data Overview
Overview of the relational datasets provided (orders, customers, products, reviews), and rationale for selecting specific tables and joins for modelling.

## 3. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering
Key cleaning steps, aggregations, and engineered features designed to capture customer behaviour and transaction patterns relevant to review outcomes.

## 4. Modelling Approach
Description of the chosen machine learning model(s), justification for their use, and framing of the prediction task as a business decision problem.

## 5. Evaluation Strategy
Discussion of evaluation metrics (e.g. precision, recall) and how they relate to efficient incentive targeting rather than raw predictive accuracy.

## 6. Business Insights & Recommendations
Interpretation of results and recommendations on whether and how such a model should be deployed in practice.

# Review Prediction for Targeted Customer Incentives

## Context
This project is based on an academic consulting-style assignment completed as part of the *MSc Business Analytics* programme at Warwick Business School.

The task was framed as a real-world business pitch for a large eCommerce platform, with the goal of predicting which customers are most likely to leave positive reviews so that incentives can be targeted efficiently.

## Business Problem
Online platforms rely heavily on positive customer reviews, but incentivising every customer is costly and inefficient.

The objective was to:
- Predict which customers are most likely to leave positive reviews
- Enable targeted incentives rather than blanket campaigns
- Evaluate models based on business usefulness, not just accuracy

## Approach (High Level)
- Joined and prepared multiple relational datasets representing orders, customers, products, and reviews
- Engineered behavioural and transactional features
- Trained and evaluated classification models to predict review sentiment
- Focused evaluation on precision, recall, and business trade-offs rather than raw accuracy

## Outcome
The analysis demonstrated that predictive models can meaningfully support targeted review-incentive strategies, improving efficiency while maintaining review quality.

## Tech Stack
